# GPU 
The RTX 5070 Ti requires NVIDIA driver 570+ with mandatory open-source kernel modules,currently only available through the graphics-drivers PPA on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS.
Linux Mint Forums Ubuntu's default repositories lack the required drivers, making PPA installation essential for RTX 5070 Ti support as of August 2025.


Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS ships with driver versions up to 560.x in default repositories, while RTX 5070 Ti requires minimum 570.x with open-source kernel modules.

"For cutting-edge platforms such as NVIDIA Blackwell, you must use the open-source GPU kernel modules. The proprietary drivers are unsupported on these platforms." 
Linux Mint Forums This architectural shift means traditional nvidia-driver-XXX packages will fail completely, requiring nvidia-driver-XXX-open variants exclusively. 

Critical warning: Using standard nvidia-driver-570 (proprietary) instead of nvidia-driver-570-open causes complete system failure
